    "text": "1 Education\nUniversidad Autónoma de Querétaro | Querétaro, Querétaro B.S. in Physics Engineering | Aug 2015 - July 2022\nUniversidad Autónoma de Querétaro | Querétaro, Querétaro Diploma course in Mathematical Data Science | Feb 2024 - June 2024\n\n\n2 Experience\n\n2.1 Continental | R&D Center, Querétaro\nData Analyst and Data Scientist | July 2024 - Present\n\nCreation of a Power BI Dashboard to analyze the engineers reported hours. The dashboard makes it easy to recognize trends based on projects milestones and is helpful for making decisions before a workload overload.\nDeveloped an NLP-based clustering tool (doc2vec + KNN) to visualize and analyze the complexity of our product based on the number of requirements and them mutual relationship. This would be helpful for detect which cluster owners need to collaborate with each other to be more efficient.\nDeveloped a data analysis platform in Python for managing and analyzing IBM JAZZ tickets. This solution featured a robust SQLite schema and a semantic search module leveraging FAISS and Sentence Transformers. Developed and integrated machine learning models for topic clustering, work item recommendations and test cases similarity. Delivered the final platform as an interactive Streamlit application for end-user search and data visualization.\nLead Langflow experimentation with LLM models to design and execute RAG pipelines, creating a conversational AI assistant to enhance support for discipline engineers.\n\nTest Manager | July 2024 - Present\n\nWork with product managers, engineers, and business teams to align testing strategies with projects milestones.\nPresented insights to leadership using dashboards and reports.\nManaged project tracking in Agile environments, ensuring timely delivery of test results through sprint planning.\n\nSW Tester | Sept 2021 - July 2024\n\nWorked with complex data protocols (CAN/UDS), gaining experience in parsing and interpreting structured/unstructured data.\nAutomating repetitive tasks with Python, allowing more focus on high-impact tasks.\nTest embedded software for automotive braking systems (Ford, Stellantis), ensuring full traceability and milestone alignment via CI/CD pipelines.\nCollaborated with multidisciplinary teams to translate business requirements into test cases.\nDebugged and interpreted data logs with SW developers to diagnose issues and applying root-cause analysis.\n\n\n\n2.2 UNAM | UMDI, Juriquilla, Querétaro\nResearch Stay | 2017 - 2021\n\nHelping Dr. Saúl Iván Hernández Hernández in his investigation. This implied learning about colloids simulations and its physics analysis using parallel paradigms in linux environments.\nPapers reading for weekly discussions.\nSending runs of molecular simulations to the GNU/Linux queuing system.\nAutomating the execution of these runs with the help of scripting in Bash.\nAnalyzing the terabytes of results with the help of Python and its packages Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.\n\n\n\n\n3 Skills\n\nAI/ML and GenAI: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Langflow and RAG knowledge.\nProgramming: Python and its popular libraries as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebooks; Bash, Git, SQL.\nDevOps & Deployment: Docker, Git-based CI/CD, API deployment using Flask and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\nMiscellaneous: Power BI, Debugging, Quality Assurance Mindset.\nMethodologies: Agile, Scrum & Kanban, Problem Resolution Management, Technical Documentation.\nCertifications: ISTQB Foundation.\nLanguages: Professional English and Spanish as mother language.\n\n\n\n4 Extracurricular Activity\nMachine Learning Student | UAQ | Aug 2019 - Dec 2019 I took an elective course with students of the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, where we were looking at algorithms such as KNN, K-Means, random forest, among others, for wine classification and recognition of handwritten numbers.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
